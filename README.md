# AI & Data Science Bootcamp Projects

This repository contains practical data analysis and machine learning projects completed during the AI & Data Science Bootcamp.

The goal of this repository is to apply data analysis and machine learning concepts through practical implementations rather than theoretical notes.

## Bootcamp Scope

The projects in this repository cover:

- Python programming for data science
- Data analysis with NumPy and Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- CRM Analytics (RFM, CLTV prediction)
- Measurement and A/B testing problems
- Recommendation systems
- SQL for data analysis
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Machine learning (supervised & unsupervised learning)
- Generative AI fundamentals and LLM concepts
- AI-assisted workflows and automation

The bootcamp includes hands-on projects such as customer segmentation, recommendation systems, machine learning prediction models, and AI-assisted decision support scenarios.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a small project or application focusing on a specific data problem:
project_name/
│
├── notebook.ipynb
├── README.md
└── dataset_info.md

## Objective

To build a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning while transitioning towards data-driven problem solving in domain-specific environments such as BIM and digital construction.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SQL
- Data Visualization Libraries
- Machine Learning Algorithms
